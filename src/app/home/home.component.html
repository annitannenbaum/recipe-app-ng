            <h3>About Community Kitchen</h3>
            <p>This project was first envisioned to be a small database for a bunch of recipes I had created over the years and hadn't found an adequate way to store, maintain and share.
            As my first real-life project to apply my newly-gained (and very basic) Python-skills, I didn't expect much. Some basic tables in SQL and a small interface to manage recipes. <br>
            But soon I thought to myself "why not go all-in and actually create something worthwile?". <br><br>
            Many of my friends and even my grandma had expressed interest in an easily accessible (web) app that would allow them to save and share recipes. <br><br>
            So there we go, a fully-fledged Web App to manage and share recipes, to inspire and communicate. </p><br>
